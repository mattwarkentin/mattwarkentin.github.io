## Bio

Matt received his BSc in Medical Sciences and MSc in Epidemiology from Brock University. Matt is currently a PhD candidate in Epidemiology at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto and a Doctoral Fellow at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. Matt's doctoral work is co-supervised by Kieran  R. Campbell and Rayjean J. Hung. 

Briefly, his research focuses on the molecular epidemiology of cancers. In particular, his work includes integrating genomics into high-risk stratification models for lung cancer screening, and using deep learning to analyze biomedical images to aid in the clinical-management of screen-detected pulmonary lesions.
