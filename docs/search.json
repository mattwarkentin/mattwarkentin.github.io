Matt’s doctoral work is co-supervised by Kieran R. Campbell and Rayjean J. Hung.\n            Briefly, his research focuses on the molecular epidemiology of cancers. In particular, his work includes integrating genomics into high-risk stratification models for lung cancer screening, and using deep learning to analyze biomedical images to aid in the clinical-management of screen-detected pulmonary lesions.\n            \n            \n            Education\n            University of Toronto | Toronto, ON, Canada\n            Ph.D. in Molecular Epidemiology | September 2016 - Present\n            University of Toronto | Toronto, ON, Canada\n            Trainee, Strategic Training for Advanced Genetic Epidemiology | September 2016 - Present\n            Brock University | St. Catharines, ON, Canada\n            M.Sc. in Epidemiology | September 2013 - May 2015\n            Brock University | St. Catharines, ON, Canada\n            B.Sc. in Medical Sciences | September 2009 - April 2013\n            \n            \n            Research Experience\n            Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute | Doctoral Fellow | September 2016 - Present\n            Harvard University | Visiting Scholar | Summer 2019\n            Alberta Health Services | Research Associate | January 2015 - August 2015\n            \n            \n            Teaching\n            University of Toronto\n            Teaching Assistant\n            Biostats I (CHL5201) | 2019\n            Biostats II (CHL5202) | 2020\n            Epidemiologic Methods I (CHL5401) | 2016-2017\n            Epidemiologic Methods II (CHL5402) | 2017-2018\n            \n            Brock University\n            Course Instructor\n            Modern Epidemiology (MPHA 5P03) | 2018\n            \n            Teaching Assistant\n            Biostatistics I (HLSC 2P07) | 2013-2015\n            Biostatistics II (HLSC 2P07) | 2013-2015\n            Research Methods in Epidemiology (HLSC 2P07) | 2015\n            Research Methods in Health (HLSC 2P07) | 2015\n            Medical Microbiology (HLSC 2P07) | 2015\n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Matt Warkentin\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Bio\n              Matt received his BSc in Medical Sciences and MSc in Epidemiology from Brock University.
